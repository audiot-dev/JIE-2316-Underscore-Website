# AudioT Corporate Website

This repository is for AudioT's website, where AudioT presents their innovation for monitoring animal welfare to the public.

## IMPORTANT
Previous development on the website was done inside the AudioT1 organization. When transfering website deployment from a team member's personal Vercel account to the AudioT development account, we discovered that Vercel requires all deployments from a GitHub organization to be done through a Team account, which costs $20/month. Therefore, the Github repo for the website in the AudioT Development's personal GitHub should be used. Any changes made to the Github repo in the organization will not be reflected in the live deployment.
